# For-Burp-Intruder-WAF-Bypass-Payload-Repository

Hi evryone,

I know you need an payload list repository for WAF bypass and for bug finding. So I got to work and created a payload repository.


## Features

This repository has been created for you to hunt bugs more easily. 

More vuln payload lists and new payloads will be added every week. 

Payloads in this repository were collected from platforms such as hackerone, medium and github. This repository is divided into "vuln exploit" and "vuln find". If you want to detect with intruder or burp bounty look for file named find vuln; If you want to exploit vulns, look for file named "vuln exploit".

The vuln exploit file is currently empty, but new wordlists will be added soon.

Only about 1 - 1,5% of payloads are faulty
